Data Privacy Audit Report 
Organization: Keshav Mahavidyalaya (Delhi University) 
Audit Date: October 25, 2024 
Auditor: Ankush Kumar
Objective: Assess data privacy practices to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

1.	Scope Definition 
Objective:  Assess the collection, processing, and storage of student, staff, and faculty data to identify privacy risks and ensure compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). 
Scope: Includes student and staff databases, admission systems, online student portals, and departmental databases involved in data handling. 
Limitations:  Excludes data managed solely by third-party vendors.

2.	Data Types and Sources Identification 

Data Types: 
- Personal Data: Names, contact details, ID numbers, academic records, health data. 
- Sensitive Data: Health and disability information, financial data (scholarships, fees). 
-Financial Data: Payment history, bank account details for payroll and reimbursements. 

Data Sources: 
- Internal: Registration forms, academic records, payroll systems. 
- External: Online admission portal, third-party assessment tools. 

Data Flow Mapping :
- Collection: Data is collected via online admission forms, departmental requests, and academic portals. 
- Processing: Data is processed for admissions, academic record-keeping, and financial disbursements. 
- Storage: Data is stored in central and departmental databases with restricted access. 
- Sharing: Data is occasionally shared with third parties (e.g., scholarship bodies, exam boards) with explicit agreements.

3.	Policies and Procedures Review 

Privacy Policy Review: 
Keshav Mahavidyalaya's privacy policy was reviewed for compliance with GDPR, as the university enrolls international students. 

Finding: 
The policy adequately addresses data collection and user rights but lacks clarity on third party data sharing. 

Data Retention Policy: 
Data retention periods vary by data type. Student records are kept indefinitely, while financial data is retained for 7 years. Finding: Retention policy aligns with industry practices but could benefit from more granular guidelines on sensitive data retention. 

Incident Response Plan: 
The university has a documented response plan with designated response teams. Finding: The plan is comprehensive but lacks a formal testing schedule to ensure readiness.

4.	Compliance Assessment 

Regulatory Compliance: 
GDPR compliance verified, as international data transfers occur for student records. Local privacy laws (India's IT Act) are also adhered to. Finding: Generally compliant, but improvements are recommended for clearer privacy notices during data collection. 

Internal Standards 
Finding: University follows ISO 27001 guidelines but does not have formal certification.



5.	Data Inventory and Classification 

Data Inventory: 
All data types were listed, detailing personal, sensitive, and financial data held by each department. 
Data Classification: 
Data has been classified as public, internal, and sensitive, with appropriate access controls in place. 
Finding: 
Classification and access levels are well-defined but should be updated annually.

6.	Access Controls Review 
User Access:  Access is role-based, with sensitive data limited to authorized personnel. 
Finding: Access levels are appropriate but could be refined with stricter criteria for sensitive data access. 
Authentication Methods: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for all sensitive systems. Finding: Strong authentication controls; regular audits of MFA effectiveness are recommended.

7.	Security Measures Assessment 
Data Encryption: Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS protocols; sensitive data at rest is also encrypted. 
Finding: Encryption is robust; however, an upgrade to end-to-end encryption for all data is suggested. 
Network Security: Firewall and intrusion detection systems are in place. Finding: Network security measures are effective; annual penetration testing would further strengthen security. 
Physical Security: Data servers are located in secure, monitored facilities. 
Finding: Physical security is sufficient; monthly access reviews for server rooms are advised.

8.Third-Party Risk Assessment 
Vendor Management: 
Contracts with third-party vendors include data protection clauses. 
Finding: Vendor agreements are thorough but could benefit from annual compliance checks. 
Data Sharing Agreements: 
Data sharing agreements with scholarship boards and exam bodies are well-documented. Finding: Review frequency should be increased to ensure compliance with evolving privacy regulations.


9.	Training and Awareness 
Employee Training: Data privacy training sessions are conducted annually. 
Finding: Training is effective but lacks specific content on handling sensitive data. 
Awareness Campaigns: Monthly email reminders and posters are used to promote data privacy best practices. Finding; Awareness initiatives are consistent; including interactive workshops could improve engagement.


10.	Incident History Review 
Breach History: A minor data breach occurred in 2022 due to a phishing attempt. 
Finding: Incident was well-managed, but phishing resistance could be improved through additional training 
Mitigation Measures: Post-breach measures include improved email filtering and staff training. 
Finding: Measures are effective; expanding phishing simulations could further strengthen defense.
11.	Risk Assessment and Reporting 
Identified Vulnerabilities: 
Potential risk of over-access due to broad access control. 
Minor risk with third-party data sharing compliance. 
Risk Prioritization: High priority for access control refinement. Medium priority for third-party compliance monitoring. 
Report Findings: Summary of findings, prioritized recommendations, and action plan were documented and shared with university management.


12.	Follow-Up and Continuous Improvement 
Regular Audits: Annual audits are scheduled to maintain data privacy standards. 
Feedback Mechanism: A feedback loop was established to incorporate suggestions and maintain continuous improvement. 
Conclusion: Keshav Mahavidyalaya is largely compliant with data privacy standards, although some areas for improvement have been identified, including enhanced access controls, third-party compliance checks, and more frequent incident testing. Recommendations were provided, and a follow-up audit is scheduled for the next year.
